# Working Modes

This document outlines the two primary working modes we'll be using during our collaboration.

1. Brainstorming Mode
In this mode:
No code changes should be made
Focus is on clearly understanding requirements
Questions should be asked to clarify understanding
No assumptions should be made
Always ask questions when unsure about any aspect

2. Implementation Mode
In this mode:
We implement all changes discussed during the brainstorming phase
Code changes are made according to the agreed-upon plans
Requirements from brainstorming are transformed into working code
Process Flow
We will typically begin with Brainstorming Mode to ensure we have a complete understanding of requirements before moving to Implementation Mode for actual code development.
